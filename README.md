# Projeto de Cards de Colaboradores com React

Este projeto utiliza React para criar cards dinâmicos de colaboradores, exibindo informações relevantes de acordo com seus cargos. A aplicação proporciona uma maneira fácil e organizada de visualizar a equipe, destacando as habilidades e responsabilidades de cada colaborador.

### Funcionalidades
**Cards Dinâmicos:** Cada colaborador é representado por um card dinâmico que exibe informações específicas, como nome, cargo e descrição.

**Organização por Cargos:** Os cards são agrupados de acordo com os cargos, proporcionando uma visão organizada da equipe.

**Componentes React Reutilizáveis:** A aplicação utiliza componentes React reutilizáveis para facilitar a manutenção e extensão do código.

### Tecnologias Utilizadas
**React:** Biblioteca JavaScript para a construção de interfaces de usuário.

**JavaScript (ES6+):** Linguagem de programação para a lógica e manipulação de dados.

**CSS:** Estilização para tornar os cards visualmente atraentes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
